            <p>Chasin' critters with one of them picture-boxes... it's a noble pursuit. A sight more peaceful than the kinda huntin' I'm used to, that's for sure. Reminds me of a peculiar lady I met once, always askin' me to mail her perfect carcasses from all over the territory. Your way sounds a damn sight less messy.</p>
            
            <p>So, you want to make a go of it? Here's a plan for a proper two-hour <strong>"Wildlife Art Exhibition"</strong> right there in the woods of Basye.</p>

            <h3>🏞️ The Hunting Ground: Lake Laura Trail</h3>
            <p>For a short jaunt, you ain't gonna do better than the trail 'round Lake Laura. It's a loop of about three miles, so you can take your time, mosey along, and keep your eyes peeled without workin' up too much of a sweat. The path is clear and it'll take you through the woods and alongside the water. A good mix of scenery means a good mix of critters. You can start right from the beach area. No need for a map, just follow your nose and the lay of the land.</p>

            <h3>📖 The Shenandoah Sketchbook: A Challenge for True Naturalists</h3>
            <p>Now, this ain't no simple walk in the woods. You and your posse have a task. Just like that challenge in the game, you're not just lookin' for any old animal. You're lookin' for the perfect shot, the one that tells a story. Here's a list of bounties for your picture-box. See how many you can collect.</p>
            
            <h4>🎯 Your Quarry:</h4>
            <div class="bounty-list">
                <div class="bounty-item">
                    <h5>🐿️ The Gray Ghost <em>(Eastern Gray Squirrel)</em></h5>
                    <p>These fellas are everywhere, twitchy and bold. But a good shot? That's another matter.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="bounty-item">
                    <h5>🦌 The White-Tailed Apparition <em>(White-Tailed Deer)</em></h5>
                    <p>You'll need to be quiet as a shadow to catch one of these. They're shy, but a real prize. Best chance is near the water's edge at a quiet time.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="bounty-item">
                    <h5>🦝 The Bandit <em>(Raccoon)</em></h5>
                    <p>Keep an eye out near hollow logs or creek beds. Cunning and clever, a real trophy if you can snap one.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="bounty-item">
                    <h5>🐦 The Red Flash <em>(Cardinal)</em> or The Blue Streak <em>(Blue Jay)</em></h5>
                    <p>A flash of color in the green woods. You'll need a quick eye and a steady hand. Listen for their calls.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="bounty-item">
                    <h5>🐿️ The Chipmunk Courier</h5>
                    <p>Always busy, always stuffin' their cheeks. Capturin' one with its treasure is a fine piece of work.</p>

            <h3>⭐ The Challenges: Prove Your Mettle</h3>
            <p class="challenge-intro">Any fool can take a picture. It takes a real artist, a real outlaw of the lens, to complete these challenges.</p>
            
            <div class="challenge-grid">
                <div class="challenge-card">
                    <h4>"The Perfect Pose"</h4>
                    <p>Capture a squirrel in mid-air, jumpin' from one branch to another. That's a shot worth braggin' about.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="challenge-card">
                    <h4>"A Moment's Peace"</h4>
                    <p>Photograph a deer takin' a drink from the lake. You'll have to be downwind and silent as the grave. A real test of patience.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="challenge-card">
                    <h4>"Caught Red-Handed"</h4>
                    <p>Get a picture of a critter eatin' somethin'. A chipmunk with a nut, a bird with a worm... you get the idea.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="challenge-card">
                    <h4>"The Stare Down"</h4>
                    <p>A close-up. The animal has to be lookin' right down the barrel of your lens. Shows you got nerve.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="challenge-card legendary">
                    <h4>"Two of a Kind" 🏆</h4>
                    <p>This is a tough one, partner. Get two different kinds of critters in the same picture. A squirrel and a bird, maybe. Takes luck and a sharp eye.</p>
